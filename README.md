# Made in China with Love

Not all products marked with "Designed and Made in China" automatically makes
it poor in quality. In this EAGLE library, I present some Designed and Made in
China semiconductor products that are not only good in quality, but also pretty
awesome in general.

## Datasheets

Datasheets are not included. Should I find a readable English datasheet for any
paticular chip I will link it in. If the demands are high I will translate some
datasheets for English users.

## Example circuits

Included schematics are examples of how the chips should be used. You can copy
them directly into your design. By default all resistors and capacitors are 0603
size. 10ÂµF ceramic capacitors and LEDs are 0805 size. You may need to find a
better part for the inductors.
